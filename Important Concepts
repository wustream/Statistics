# Law of Large Numbers:

X1, X2, ..., Xn are IID random variables, Xi has finite mean m.
Sample mean will converge to true mean m as n increases.

sum(Xi)/n --> m (n--> infinity)

Population mean can be estimated by sample mean. 

Good sample mean estimator should be unbiased: Expected mean of the sample mean is the same as population mean. 

unbiased good estimator may still have some distribution, but law of large numbers is more strict as in the later case the populaion mean is a certain number, not distribution any more.

# Central Limit Theorem:
X1, X2, ..., Xn are IID random variables, with finite mean m and variance sigma^2.
Sample mean will follow N(m, sigma^2/n).
sum(Xi)/n ~ N(m, sigma^2/n)

Replacing sigma by sample standard deviation s, CLT still holds.
